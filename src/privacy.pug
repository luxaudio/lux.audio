          3. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
        p.
          To Provide Products, Services, and Information: As described above, we
          collect information from you so that we can provide products and services
          that you purchase at the Site, and provide information that you request
          from us. We use your personally identifiable information to contact you
          about your orders, process credit card / debit card transactions, and ship
          products to you. We may send you information about our products and
          services, and new offerings. We may provide information to third party
          service providers that help us process orders, and fulfill and deliver
          products and services that you purchase from us. We may use third parties
          to help host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide
          marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information
          from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will
          have access to your personally identifiable information in order to provide
          these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual
          and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping
          us provide the service.
        p.
          Advertising: We may use how you browse and shop in
          order to show you ads for Us or our advertising partners that are more
          relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to
          provide relevant interest-based advertising to you. Interest-based ads are
          ads presented to you based on your browsing behavior in order to provide
          you with ads more tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads may
          be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites
          not owned by Us. We belong to ad networks that may use your browsing
          history across participating websites to show you interest-based
          advertisements on those websites. You can opt-out of receiving
          interest-based ads from us by sending an email to #{supportEmail}.
          Please note that if you choose to opt out, you will continue to
          see ads on our Site, but they will not be based on how you browse and shop.
          If your browser sends a “do not track” signal or similar mechanism to
          indicate you do not wish to be tracked or receive interest-based ads, we
          will treat that signal as an opt-out. We allow advertising networks to
          collect personally identifiable information about our user’s online
          activities when you leave this Site. To learn more about interest-based
          advertisements and your opt-out rights and options, visit the Digital
          Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative websites (
          www.aboutads.info and www.networkadvertising.org).

          confidential. We do not sell, rent, or share personally identifiable
          information with third parties for the third party to market its products
          and services.
        p.
          Your Consent: In addition to the sharing described elsewhere
          in this Policy, we will share personally identifiable information with
          companies, organizations or individuals apart from Us when we have your
          consent to do so.
        p.
          Legal Proceedings:  We will share personally identifiable
          information with third party companies, organizations or individuals
          apart from Us if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation
          or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: Meet any
          applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable
          governmental request. Enforce applicable Terms and Conditions, including
          investigation of potential violations. Detect, prevent, or otherwise
          address fraud, security or technical issues. Protect against harm to the
          rights, property or safety of Us, our users, customers or the public as
          required or permitted by law. Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of
          Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business
          changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the
          Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy
          proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personally
          identifiable information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted
          otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the
          promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree
          differently.
