          Help get everyone Stoned
        p.
          When you refer people to us, that's the most love you can possibly
          give us. The referral program lets us show some love right back. So
          here's how it works.
        h2.
          What you do
        p.
          After you sign up for an account (if you've bought, we've already set
          one up for you), you can use your unique link to spread the word,
          through your social media pages, blogs, etc. Please don't post your
          link to sites or forums that don't belong to you (that's spamming!),
          and don't try to run paid ads with your referral link. When you put
          your referral link out there, people who show up at the website can
          earn you points.
        h2.
          What they do
        p.
          When people click your referral link, they can:
            ul
              li.
                Get Stoned - for everyone who purchases after clicking your
                link, you'll get a sick 420 points. The sale has to stick; if
                someone refunds, we have to refund the points, too!
              li.
                Get Hooked Up - for everyone who signs up to get updates from
                us, you'll get a very cool 10 points. The email has to be valid
                and get confirmed for the points to stick.
        h2.
          What you get
        p.
          As you keep getting points, we keep paying out rewards.
