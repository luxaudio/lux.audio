          | Received my Stoned earbuds yesterday and so far I am impressed. Wore one only for a bike ride this morning and it worked flawlessly, as well as staying secure in my ear. Great job, Stoned!

          | All I can say is wow. Surprisingly GREAT sound. Paired extremely easy and looking forward to running with them. That will be the true test. But for now, I'm impressed.

            | That surprised me. I've used some Bluetooth 'phones before, and even the slightest lag can be super-annoying.

            | The fit (I used the largest of three provided plugs) is great. I could headbang like a muhfug with these things and they wouldn't budge. I've been wearing them for about an hour and they're barely noticeable.

            |The Earphones are easy to pair. To pair them to each other and your phone, you press the button and hold it — the round silver piece on them — it will say “power on” and then say “pairing.” You can then press the button on the other, and they’ll beep a few times and sync to each other. Then you go to your phone’s Bluetooth section and select the Earphones.

            strong It is very simple.
